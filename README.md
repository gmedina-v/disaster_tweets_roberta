# disaster_tweets_roberta
NLP tweet classification project with transformers

This repository showcases my solution of the Kaggle's disaster tweets competition using ðŸ¤— Huggingface's transformers library. The solution uses the RoBERTa model for sequence classification, fine-tuned on a labelled training set of tweets. This can be viewed as a code-along demo where relevant explanations are given all through the code.
